Name(s) and Login(s):



1. Dennis Ritchie, the creator of the C programming language,
was born on September 9th, 1941.  If he were still alive,
how old would he be today?  Find out by running the `birthday`
program on the appropriate inputs and enter your solution here.
Answer: Today is 22/10/2023
His birthday was 9/9/1941.Hello Dennis you are 69 years 2 weeeks and 4day old today. 




2. Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of the C++ programming
language, the object-oriented extension of C, was born on
December 30th, 1950.  How old is he today?
 Answer:
 Today is 22/10/2023
His birthday was 30/12/1950.Hello bjarne.
 you are 69 years 2 weeeks and 4day old today. 




3. Software testing often involves testing code with known
"bad" input in an attempt to break it (sometimes this is
referred to as *fuzzing*).  Try breaking the `birthday_cli`
program by giving it "bad" input and observe the consequences.
Give at least two examples of potentially bad input and the
results you observe.
Answer:
Example: Bad input:Madiha Mujahid 1900 4
result: today was 
Hello Madiha you are 0 years 0 months 0 days today.
Example: Bad input :99/0m12
your birthday was 
Hello, 99 yor are 0 years 0 months 0days today.

5. Use your working currency conversion to determine
the exchange amounts for the following inputs:

  a) $250.25
  Answer:
  Half of Dollar exchange to 92.34255GBP
  Half of Dollar exchange to 16873.857422 JPY

  b) $1,000.52
  Answer: 
  Half of Dollar exchange to 369.192017 GBP
  Half of Dollar exchange to 67463.062500 JPY

  c) $968,410.12
  Answer:
  Half of Dollar exchange to 357.192017 GBP
  Half of Dollar exchange to 65270.70488 JPY


6. Suppose that you had used only `int` types
in your conversion program.  Would you be able
to use it to convert the US national debt
(which as of 2020 was \$26,009,754,625,487)?
Why or why not?




7. Mixed types

a) Run the `area` program with 3 and 4 as inputs.  
What value do you get?  Is this result correct?


b) Execute the program again with inputs 3 and 5.
Does the program give correct results?  Why not?


c) Fix the program by editing the `area.c` source
code so that the program produces correct results.
